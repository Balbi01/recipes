    <h1>Detroit Pizza</h1>

    <p>Try this Detroit-style pizza recipe the next time you want a crunchy, crispy, cheese-laden slice! 
        Detroit-style pizza is often referred to as a deep-dish pizza, but I don't think that accurately 
        captures the essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good pizza. It has the flavor elements of a 
        slightly charred thin-crust pizza and the texture of a light and airy focaccia. If you use a properly 
        shaped pan, the edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.</p>

    </ul>

    <strong>Instructions</strong>

    <ol>Gather all ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>Pour warm water into the bowl of stand mixer; mix in yeast and sugar and let dissolve. </ol>
    <ol>Add 2 teaspoons olive oil, salt, and bread flour. Knead mixture together with a dough hook attachment 
        until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic. </ol>
    <ol>Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan; use your fingers to spread 
        oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then pull and 
        stretch dough into a rectangular shape. </ol>
    <ol>Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. </ol>
    <ol>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder to a 
        simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes. </ol>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into bowl. 
        Toss lightly to mix together. </ol>
    <ol>Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while 
        stretching and pushing it into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch 
        dough up the sides about 1/2 inch or so. </ol>
    <ol>Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese evenly over top, making sure to fully cover 
        all the edges where dough meets the pan.</ol>
    <ol>Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top. </ol>
    <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool 
        for 5 minutes. </ol>
    <ol>Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into rectangular pieces. </ol>
    <ol>Serve immediately and enjoy! </ol>
