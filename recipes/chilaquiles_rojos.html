    <h1>Chilaquiles rojos</h1>

    <p>Chilaquiles rojos was one of my favorite comfort foods growing up. This recipe with chicken is more like
        a casserole than the traditional chilaquiles. Great for a potluck or party and you'll get lots of 
        compliments from your guests! It can be made hot or mild depending upon your heat tolerances or 
        preferences. </p>

    <strong>Instuctions:</strong>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch casserole dish. </li>
        <li>Combine drained tomatoes and chipotle chiles in adobo in a blender; puree until smooth. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened, 
            about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant; add pureed tomato-chile sauce and simmer until 
            mixture starts to thicken. Pour in chicken broth and stir in cumin, oregano, and salt; let simmer 
            until mixture thickens. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Mix tortilla chips and tomato-chile sauce, folding carefully to cover chips completely. You may have 
            to do this in 2 batches. </li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of the casserole dish with half of the tortilla chip mixture. Sprinkle a layer of 
            Mexican cheese and cotija cheese on top. Add shredded chicken to cover all of the cheese. Season 
            chicken with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with 1/2 of the green onions and 1/2 of the cilantro. 
            Spoon 3/4 of the sour cream evenly over top. Spread with the remaining tortilla mixture then top 
            with remaining Mexican and cotija cheeses. Cover with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until mixture is bubbly and cheese is melted, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove 
            from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Serve with sour cream, green onions, and cilantro. </li>
    </ol>
